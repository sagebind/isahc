//! The practical HTTP client that is fun to use.
//!
//! Here are some of Isahc's key features:
//!
//! - Full support for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
//! - Configurable request timeouts, redirect policies, Unix sockets, and many
//!   more settings.
//! - Offers an ergonomic synchronous API as well as a runtime-agnostic
//!   asynchronous API with support for async/await.
//! - Fully asynchronous core, with incremental reading and writing of request
//!   and response bodies and connection multiplexing.
//! - Sessions and cookie persistence.
//! - Automatic request cancellation on drop.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Sending requests is as easy as calling a single function. Let's make a
//! simple GET request to an example website:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use isahc::prelude::*;
//!
//! let mut response = isahc::get("https://example.org")?;
//! println!("{}", response.text()?);
//! # Ok::<(), isahc::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! By default, sending a request will wait for the response, up until the
//! response headers are received. The returned response struct includes the
//! response body as an open stream implementing [`Read`](std::io::Read).
//!
//! Sending a POST request is also easy, and takes an additional argument for
//! the request body:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let response = isahc::post("https://httpbin.org/post", "make me a salad")?;
//! # Ok::<(), isahc::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Isahc provides several other simple functions for common HTTP request types:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! isahc::put("https://httpbin.org/put", "have a salad")?;
//! isahc::head("https://httpbin.org/get")?;
//! isahc::delete("https://httpbin.org/delete")?;
//! # Ok::<(), isahc::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to customize the request by adding headers, setting timeouts,
//! etc, then you can create a [`Request`][Request] using a builder-style fluent
//! interface, then finishing it off with a [`send`][RequestExt::send]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use isahc::{prelude::*, Request};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! let response = Request::post("https://httpbin.org/post")
//!     .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
//!     .timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))
//!     .body(r#"{
//!         "speed": "fast",
//!         "cool_name": true
//!     }"#)?
//!     .send()?;
//! # Ok::<(), isahc::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! For even more examples used in complete programs, please check out the
//! [examples](https://github.com/sagebind/isahc/tree/master/examples) directory
//! in the project repo.
//!
//! # Feature tour
//!
//! Below is a brief overview of some notable features of Isahc. Check out the
//! rest of the documentation for even more guides and examples.
//!
//! ## Easy request functions
//!
//! You can start sending requests without any configuration by using the global
//! functions in this module, including [`get`], [`post`], and [`send`]. These
//! use a shared HTTP client instance with sane defaults, so it is easy to get
//! up and running. They should work perfectly fine for many use-cases, so don't
//! worry about graduating to more complex APIs if you don't need them.
//!
//! ## Request and response traits
//!
//! Isahc includes a number of traits in the [`prelude`] module that extend the
//! [`Request`] and [`Response`] types with a plethora of extra methods that
//! make common tasks convenient and allow you to configure more advanced
//! connection and protocol details.
//!
//! Here are some of the key traits to read about:
//!
//! - [`Configurable`](config::Configurable): Configure request parameters.
//! - [`RequestExt`]: Manipulate and send requests.
//! - [`ResponseExt`]: Get information about the corresponding request or
//!   response statistics.
//! - [`ReadResponseExt`]: Consume a response body in a variety of ways.
//! - [`AsyncReadResponseExt`]: Consume an asynchronous response body in a
//!   variety of ways.
//!
//! ## Custom clients
//!
//! The free-standing functions for sending requests use a shared [`HttpClient`]
//! instance, but you can also create your own client instances, which allows
//! you to customize the default behavior for requests that use it.
//!
//! See the documentation for [`HttpClient`] and [`HttpClientBuilder`] for more
//! information on creating custom clients.
//!
//! ## Asynchronous requests
//!
//! Requests are always executed asynchronously under the hood. This allows a
//! single client to execute a large number of requests concurrently with
//! minimal overhead. Even synchronous applications can benefit!
//!
//! If you are writing an asynchronous application, you can reap additional
//! benefits from the async nature of the client by using the asynchronous
//! methods available to prevent blocking threads in your code. All request
//! methods have an asynchronous variant that ends with `_async` in the name.
//! Here is our first example rewritten to use async/await syntax:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn run() -> Result<(), isahc::Error> {
//! use isahc::prelude::*;
//!
//! let mut response = isahc::get_async("https://httpbin.org/get").await?;
//! println!("{}", response.text().await?);
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! Since we sent our request using [`get_async`], no blocking will occur, and
//! the asynchronous versions of all response methods (such as
//! [`text`](AsyncReadResponseExt::text)) will also automatically be selected by
//! the compiler.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! Isahc is designed to be as "pay-as-you-need" as possible using Cargo feature
//! flags and optional dependencies. Unstable features are also initially
//! released behind feature flags until they are stabilized. You can add the
//! feature names below to your `Cargo.toml` file to enable them:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.isahc]
//! version = "1.7"
//! features = ["psl"]
//! ```
//!
//! Below is a list of all available feature flags and their meanings.
//!
//! ## `cookies`
//!
//! Enable persistent HTTP cookie support. Disabled by default.
//!
//! ## `http2`
//!
//! Enable compile-time support for HTTP/2 in libcurl via libnghttp2. This does
//! not actually affect whether HTTP/2 is used for a given request, but simply
//! makes it available. To configure which HTTP versions to use in a request,
//! see [`VersionNegotiation`](config::VersionNegotiation).
//!
//! To check which HTTP versions are supported at runtime, you can use
//! [`is_http_version_supported`].
//!
//! Enabled by default.
//!
//! ## `json`
//!
//! Additional serialization and deserialization of JSON bodies via
//! [serde](https://serde.rs). Disabled by default.
//!
//! ## `psl`
//!
//! Enable use of the Public Suffix List to filter out potentially malicious
//! cross-domain cookies. Implies `cookies`, disabled by default.
//!
//! ## `spnego`
//!
//! Enable support for [SPNEGO-based HTTP
//! authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4559) (`negotiate` auth
//! scheme). This makes the `negotiate` scheme available in the API and, if
//! `static-curl` is enabled, compiles libcurl with GSS-API APIs. The [MIT
//! Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) headers must be pre-installed at
//! compile time.
//!
//! ## `static-curl`
//!
//! Use a bundled libcurl version and statically link to it. Enabled by default.
//!
//! ## `text-decoding`
//!
//! Enable support for decoding text-based responses in various charsets into
//! strings. Enabled by default.
//!
//! ## `tls`
//!
//! Enable API support for TLS configuration. This feature allows you to use any
//! TLS-specific features of Isahc without selecting a particular TLS backend,
//! and is a good choice when writing a library that might require TLS support,
//! but want to allow the application writer to decide which TLS backend is
//! used.
//!
//! This feature is automatically enabled when enabling a specific TLS backend.
//! Conversely, if this feature is enabled but no backend feature is enabled, a
//! compile error will be emitted.
//!
//! ## Unstable APIs
//!
//! There are also some features that enable new incubating APIs that do not
//! have stability guarantees:
//!
//! ### `unstable-interceptors`
//!
//! Enable the new interceptors API (replaces the old unstable middleware API).
//! Unstable until the API is finalized. This an unstable feature whose
//! interface may change between patch releases.
//!
//! ### `unstable-rustls-tls`
//!
//! Use [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) as the TLS backend for HTTPS
//! requests. Currently unstable as the rustls backend in libcurl currently has
//! some known issues and is not yet recommended for production use.
//!
//! # Logging and tracing
//!
//! Isahc logs quite a bit of useful information at various levels compatible
//! with the [log](https://docs.rs/log) crate. For even more in-depth
//! diagnostics, you can use a [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing) subscriber to
//! track log events grouped by individual requests. This can be especially
//! useful if you are sending multiple requests concurrently.
//!
//! If you set the log level to `Trace` for the `isahc::wire` target, Isahc will
//! also log all incoming and outgoing data while in flight. This may come in
//! handy if you are debugging code and need to see the exact data being sent to
//! the server and being received.
