//! Definition of all client and request configuration options.
//!
//! Individual options are separated out into multiple types. Each type acts
//! both as a "field name" and the value of that option.

// Options are implemented as structs of various kinds that can be "applied" to
// a curl easy handle. This helps to reduce code duplication as there are many
// supported options, and also helps avoid having a massive function that does
// all the configuring.
//
// When adding new config options, remember to add methods for setting the
// option both in HttpClientBuilder and RequestBuilderExt. In addition, be sure
// to update the client code to apply the option when configuring an easy
// handle.
