/// Holds the current state of a trailer for a response.

/// This object acts as a shared handle that can be cloned and polled from
/// multiple threads to wait for and act on the response trailer.
///
/// There are two typical workflows for accessing trailer headers:
///
/// - If you are consuming the response body and then accessing the headers
///   afterward, then all trailers are guaranteed to have arrived (if any).
///   [`Trailer::try_get`] will allow you to access them without extra overhead.
/// - If you are handling trailers in a separate task, callback, or thread, then
///   either [`Trailer::wait`] or [`Trailer::wait_async`] will allow you to wait
///   for the trailer headers to arrive and then handle them.
///
/// Note that in either approach, trailer headers are delivered to your
/// application as a single [`HeaderMap`]; it is not possible to handle
/// individual headers as they arrive.
