//! Configuration options related to SSL/TLS for supporting [HTTPS] requests.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! Isahc does not implement the TLS protocol itself, but instead uses one of
//! various available *TLS backends* which implement support. With the default
//! crate configuration, Isahc will use the target platform's "native" TLS
//! implementation:
//!
//! - Windows: [Schannel]
//! - macOS and iOS: [Secure Transport]
//! - Linux: [OpenSSL] or one of its API-compatible forks are usually considered
//!   the "default" TLS engine on most Linux distributions and are treated as
//!   the native backend here.
//!
//! Regardless of platform, support for TLS is gated behind the optional `tls`
//! crate feature, which while enabled by default can be disabled if you don't
//! need or want to make HTTPS requests. Enabling the crate feature enables this
//! API module, but does not select which backend to use. To select which
//! backend to use, additional crate features are provided:
//!
//! - `native-tls`: Use the target platform's native TLS engine, as described
//!   earlier. This is the default.
//! - `openssl-tls`: Use OpenSSL, regardless of target platform.
//! - `rustls-tls`: Use [rustls], a modern TLS library written in Rust.
//! - `rustls-tls-native-certs`: Use [rustls] along with the
//!   [rustls-native-certs] library to allow rustls to use the platform's native
//!   root certificate store.
//!
//! There are pros and cons to different backends, and none are best for all use
//! cases. For a more in-depth look at the available backends see the [wiki
//! article on TLS
//! backends](https://github.com/sagebind/isahc/wiki/TLS-Backends).
